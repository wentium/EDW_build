Goals of Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence
	■ “We collect tons of data, but we can’t access it.”
	■ “We need to slice and dice the data every which way.”
	■ “Business people need to get at the data easily.”
	■ “Just show me what is important.”
	■ “We spend entire meetings arguing about who has the right numbers rather
		than making decisions.”
	■ “We want people to use information to support more fact-based decision
making.”
